## Toolbox for the analysis and the control of hybrid systems 

 ⚠️ **The code is not made open-source at the moment as the toolbox is in early alpha version. So, please use the functions as described in the "Example" scripts. Please email me if you encounter issues.**
 
 ⚠️ **Requires the latest version of SOSTOOLS and the semidefinite programming solver SeDuMi**

### Toolbox for the analysis and the control of linear impulsive systems (https://github.com/cbriat/HybridSystems/tree/master/Autom2013_Impulsive)
  - Dwell-time analysis of deterministic linear impulsive systems
  - State-feedback control and observer-gain design for linear impulsive systems under dwell-time constraints
  - Include simulation and plotting scripts
